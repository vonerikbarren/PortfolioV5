# Overview

- OliverJS is a simple Library / AI that I developed to assist me in finding bugs and development. On the backend, he performs basic API requests
so I can retrieve information so I can use it from the console in development. Filled with algorithms, Oliver is the conglomerate of other projects that I have
developed more or less compliled into one massive project.
